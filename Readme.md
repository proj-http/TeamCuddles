TeamCuddles Project
===================

This was started as part of a group university project.

It got cancelled after about 2-3 weeks, due to the lecturer deciding that we didn't actually need to make anything.

Idea
----

It was meant to work on a multi-touch design, and allow you to lay out photos on a digital photoframe using 'cloud' photo stores.
